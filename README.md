Whoa, just watched Control Freak and I'm spiraling, honestly. Like, what even was that ending?? You know what I mean? This whole Control Freak thing just totally went off the rails. I mean, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I actually sat there downloading the movie, thinking itâ€™d be some chill night. Nope, turns out itâ€™s a full-on rollercoaster ride with no seatbelt. ðŸ˜‚

> Seriously, why was the villain so extra though? Itâ€™s like they decided, letâ€™s just mash up every bad guy trope and see what explodes. And somehow it works, but it doesn't? Like, are the writers in on the joke, or are they the joke? Anyway, Iâ€™m all aboard for chaotic characters, but thereâ€™s a limit, ya know?

Oh, and the action scenes!! They had me clutching my couch, thinking if I should learn some of those moves. One sec theyâ€™re chatting all deep philosophical stuff, and boomâ€”next sec theyâ€™re defying a bunch of laws of physics. Itâ€™s exhausting but in a fun way? Kinda like running a marathon but for your brain. ðŸ˜…

You know what I'm saying? It's like they had a dartboard full of ideas and just went, Hey, let's just use all of them. And that soundtrack... totally out of nowhere, like did I sign up for an impromptu rave?? But yeah, I totally want to watch the movie again, just to pick up on stuff I missed while I was busy screaming internally.

int i = 0; while (true) { }

Anyway, Iâ€™m wiped but in that can't-look-away way. Gonna crash but might dream about plot holes and ridiculous fight scenes. ðŸ˜† Hit me up if you check it out, I need to know Iâ€™m not losing my mind solo here.
